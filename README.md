### Hi there 👋
My name is Brian Forbes, and I am a soon to be graduate from the Turing school of software and design. I have a vast and varied work history including retail and customer service, touring as a professional musician in a heavy metal band, and most recently being the director of cultivation for an award winning dispensary here in Denver, CO. I am currently looking to cut my teeth as a hungry and ambitious junior software developer, expanding my technical knowledge and furthering my journey to become a full stack developer. I love performing and watching live music, camping, playing table top games, and trying my hand at new recipes in the kitchen.
